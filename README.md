# Fruit Cart Frontend

I made this frontend to go with the fruit cart api I created:

https://github.com/bishoprm/fruit-cart-api

I created this React app using TypeScript and Styled Components.

### Check out the deployed app on Netlify: https://main--mellifluous-cucurucho-d51433.netlify.app/

## Run this app locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
